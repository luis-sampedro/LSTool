    <!-- PROFILE -->
    <section id="about" class="section">
      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a 25-year-old Naval Architect and Maritime Engineer from Galicia,
        Spain. I recently completed the MSc in Maritime Engineering Science
        (Yacht & High-Performance Craft) at the University of Southampton.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last years I’ve combined my engineering studies with
        hands-on experience in professional sailing circuits and foiling
        classes, focusing on performance, reliability and optimisation.
        My mid-term goal is to contribute my technical skills and my
        understanding of sailing to a high-performance yacht design team.
